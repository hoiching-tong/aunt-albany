                    <p>When I think of Aunt Albany, I think of one of my best examples in life. She has always been there for me, and has loved and cared for me like another daughter. She always supported me in all her endeavors and gives all of herself to her family and friends. She is always so trustworthy and I can talk to her about anything for hours. I could not imagine my life without her and all she has done for me. I think anyone would be lucky to have Albany Jones in their life.</p>

                    <p>The things I could say about Aunt Albany could fill up an entire novel. I can describe how much she loves me, and every single person in her life. I can tell you of all the times when one of her hugs just made a terrible day become a beautiful one. I could go on and on listing out all the reasons why I cherish her. But when it comes right down to it, Aunt Albany has always been someone I can count on in my life. She loves me unconditionally, and I know that whatever happens, I can always turn to her for comfort. She has been like a 2nd mom to me for my entire life. And for that, I'll be eternally grateful. For that, I'll love her forever.</p>

                    <br>
                    <p>There are many reasons why I love Aunt Albany: (1) she is my sister, (2) she saved my life.  I almost fell through my bedroom door window down 10 floors when I was little and would have surely die if she had not grabbed me back, (3) she is kind to people, (4) she never thinks of taking advantage of other people, and (5) she is generous. I always feel easy and comfortable to be around her. 
                    - Christopher Tong</p>
                    <p>I was rear-ended once driving out to the coast with my sister. As I was out talking to the other driver, I saw my sister falling out of my car all of a sudden, which scared the crap out of the other driver, thinking that she was seriously injured. As it turned out, my sister's foot was wrapped around the strap of her purse when trying to step out of the car, causing her to tumble out unexpectedly üòù
